q1.

I'd create main method which allows user to view account balance then a class for an open account and a class for a closed account.
A switch statement could be used to view the account balance, go into the open account via open account options or the closed account
The accounts/ classes would be accessed via if else statements to determine whether the account is open or closed.
Within the open account, there would be methods to deposit, withdraw, view statements, or close the account which would then give you the option to withdraw your money.
Within the closed account, you would only be given the option to withdraw your money should there be any left.
